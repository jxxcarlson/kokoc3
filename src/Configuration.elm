\\section{Introduction}

An inline formula, by Pythogoras: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

A displayed formula, by Cauchy:

\\begin{equation}
\\label{eq:cauchy}
  f(a) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\oint\\frac{f(z)}{z-a}dz
\\end{equation}

\\section{More stuff}

\\begin{theorem}
There are infinitely many primes $p \\equiv 1 (4)$.
\\end{theorem}

Hmmm ... I refer you to equation \\ref{eq:cauchy}.

\\image{https://www.storyofmathematics.com/images2/riemann.jpg}{B. Riemann}{float: left, width: 300}
Bernhard Riemann's life was short, but amazingly creative and productive.  From \\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann}{Wikipedia}:
\\italic{17 September 1826 â€“ 20 July 1866) was a German mathematician who made contributions to analysis, number theory, and differential geometry. In the field of real analysis, he is mostly known for the first rigorous formulation of the integral, the Riemann integral, and his work on Fourier series. His contributions to complex analysis include most notably the introduction of Riemann surfaces, breaking new ground in a natural, geometric treatment of complex analysis. His famous 1859 paper on the prime-counting function, containing the original statement of the Riemann hypothesis, is regarded as one of the most influential papers in analytic number theory. Through his pioneering contributions to differential geometry, Riemann laid the foundations of the mathematics of general relativity. He is considered by many to be one of a handful of greatest mathematicians of all time}

\\section{Getting started}

Type something in the search box, upper left, to find a document.
Or press the \\strong{Random} button.

\\section{Search Tips}

\\begin{enumerate}

\\item Type words or fragments of words to search by title.
For example, type \\strong{atom}.  If you wanted to be
more specific, you could type \\strong{hydrogen atom},
or for that mattter \\strong{ato hy}.

\\item Every document has a numerical ID, like a person's
social security number. You can type the ID in the search
box to find a document.   If someone says, "My class notes
are on document \\strong{440} at knode.io"" you
know what to do.

\\item To find all the public articles by an author
with user name \\italic{jxxcarlson}, Use
the search term \\strong{author=jxxcarlson}.
For all the articles by that author with title
including \\italic{haskell}, search on
\\strong{author=jxxcarlson, title=haskell}.

\\item You can do full text searches.  For example,
\\strong{text=atom} finds documents with \\italic{atom}
in the text.  The search \\strong{text=atom, text=oscillator}
finds those texts that also contain the word \\italic{oscillator}.

\\item Click the \\strong{Random} button to produce
a  list of random documents.


\\end{enumerate}

There is more to searching, but this is enough for now.....
