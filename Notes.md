@joelq â€” great, I will look there.  And @folkertdev, thankyou!!!

specifically `Http.expectBytesResponse` will give access to it, and then you have to transform the http response into a result as shown

Looks like requests can have a `bytesBody` or a `fileBody` as their payload (in addition to the more traditional string and JSON options)
